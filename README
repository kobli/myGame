Brief description
=====================
This should be a multiplayer online first person 3D game focused on PVP using magic and spells. It's focus will be on cooperation between players, tactics and building custom spells.


Game mechanics
=====================
TODO
- visualize the battle for each class .. isnt it too boring? just attack, attack, attack, ...
- revise the roles

Key aspects (by priority)
-------------------
- fun to play - idependent on experience
- effectivness does not depend on time spent in game
- effectivness slightly depends on understanding the game
- cooperation for higher effectivness
- usage of environment for higher effectivness

What the game should have / be
----------------------
- no progress that would prevent you from playing with less / more experienced players
	- some people want to play more often than others
- no grind - should not force players to spend lot of time in game (at least not too much) (like L2 - you can not do almost anything on lower levels)
- should allow some kind of player improvement (but not through items and levels)
	- like in WoT
		- understanding the game mechanics - should be helpful but unnecessary (how spotting works, armor and penetration, ...)
			-> sidescraping, shooting from 15 meters behind a bush, ...
		- tricks like driving against slope to compensate for low gun depression / elevation
		- memorizing parameters of character skills (dmg, reuse, ..) (LoL) / tank armor, speed, guns (dmg, reload, penetration), view range, ... (WoT) 
			- this gives advantage to players who spend more time in game - should be avoided (or the game should be fun without knowing them - like WoT)
	- rating system (used by matchmaking)
	- bad players in team should not affect the game negatively for others
		- feeding / AFK in LoL
		- AFK / team damage / (no help) in WoT
	! achievment guide (achievments as hints what to try / learn next) (what spell combinations)
- pace - somewhere between WoT and LoL
	- some roles could require lower pace than others - so we can target more potential players
? cooperate with other teammates - either like WoT (cover, spotting, ..) or LoL (timing of spells)
	- different players have different roles (attack, defense, heal, scout, builder) and they have to cooperate
	- players can empower each others spells
	- strategy (like in WoT) (probably not in random battles)
? usage of terrain / environment would be nice (trees / forests, stones, cliffs?, rivers?, weather)
	-	steep hill = fortification
	- river = fortification, ?fast transport
	-	tree = shield 
	- large rock = shield
? swamp = cage (teleport enemy into swamp)
? maps? what should they contain? what should they look like? 
- each player picks one class before the game starts - each class has different effects available (and possible different number of bodies)

Battles
---------------
? number of players in battle
	- probably varying
	- more than 20 players on each side:
		-> larger maps
		-> faster transport around the map
		-> location independant objective or map shrinking
? number of teams in battle
	- probably varying
-	rounds like in WoT - with more players they would probably have to be longer
	- is there a reason to make rounds?
? modes - standard, assault/defense (castle siege?), domination
?	worlds and continuous battles (respawn time, players can join and quit during the game)
	! longer battles: ex. 0.5 - 2 hours
	+ players can join and leave any time
	+ inactive players can be kicked
	+ large teams (and maps) possible
		- amount of players on a map stays the same (players do not die permanently) - no map shrinking necessary
		- no "waiting for enough players"
	- balancing skill and roles?
		- skill - sum of ratings in each team should be equal, autoassign and ingame queue per team
		-	roles - after choosing the team - quotas?
	? revealing teams secrets when switching teams
		- will there be any secrets? what team secrets will each player know?
	? how about larger groups of players wanting to play together? how do they join a game?
		- they should be able to start a new game
		- or join one after one (always waiting for someone else to balance)
	? changing roles during battle? should be OK


magic effects by role (=class)
-----------------
? cancel spell (for enemy structure destruction and, my own permanent spells, single use spell block (shield))
? buff cancel
? cloud / fog / smoke
	- DD (elemental?)
		- attack (fire ball / sphere (area))
	- defender
		- magic shield (all effects of each spell that flies through are multiplied by shields power)
		- stun
	- healer
		- heal
	? scout
		- no need for a dedicated role
		- just running about a map ... would be replaced by a minimap 
	o summoner / builder
		- teleporter
		- camera (palantir)
		- baricade
		- mobile base that serves as a spawn point and can be relocated and captured(?) by the enemy -- (structure -> only builder can manipulate those?)
		-? trigger
		- reporter? when something triggers the trigger, report ... (maybe show something on a map? or send msg to owner)
		? bridge (no gravity field)
	*o buffer
	*o debuffer
		- root, silence
		* join
		- buff and debuff effects can be given to areas, not players (like in L2)

stats
-------------------
! can be visualized by colors - for use in magic visual effects
- max health
- health regen
- attack
- defense
-	speed
- casting speed

Monetization
-------------------
- no pay to win
- no free to play up to ..., then pay to play (like LoTRO)
? probably donations, possibly some skins - nothing that affects the gameplay

Target platform
----------------
- Linux
- Windows

Influences
-------------
Lineage 2 (C4 / C6)
	- awesome atmosphere (music, locations), not overdesigned armor, too much grind (takes too much time, often kind of forces you to play), difficult to play with friends if they start later, simple interface compared to modern MMOS, coop
Lord of the Rings 
	- great story, magic, realistic looking (movie)
Lord of the Rings Online
	- free to play but later becomes pay to play / grind
League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm (MOBA)
	- too fast for some people, important to know the characters and their skills, play at any time, for as long as you want
World of Tanks
	- problematic matchmaking (why not based on skill?), fun to play for noobs, coop

Story
-------------
- none


spell system
======================
- possibility to create macros (= custom spells)? there could (!should) be predefined ones for beginners)
	- macros can contain other macros
- spell consists of a body (stackable for higher effect) and possibly several effects
- player can alter spell properties on the run by issuing different sets of commands (see below)
- commands are added into queue and executed on FIFO basis
- casting (and spell) interruptions
	- movement
		- reset progress in current spell component
		- continue processing the queue when the character has stopped
	- damage taken
		- reset progress in current spell component
		- cancel spell
	- death
		- abort and cancel everything
		x revoke all counted bodies and effects?
			- difficult, many details
-	player can move while holding a spell
- each part of the spell has casting time, but the actual time of casting depends also on the players casting speed
- merging / appending should take no time
? mana? maybe later - if battles are too aggresive
? area damage spells
	- how do they get to the enemy?
		? cast in place .. up to n meters away
	- when do they die?
		- just so they do not block my body
	- casting lots of them should not pay off too much
	- when would they pay off? why make them?

Magic body
-----------------
- grab_from_ground lock
- grab_from_hands lock
0) parameters
	- velocity (direction*speed)
	- size (radius)
	- die
		- on timer
		? never (on cancel spell)
		- collision with player
		- collision with terrain
		+ combinations (whatever comes first)
	- apply effect when ...
		- dying
		? collision with player (reuse delay / recharge)
		? every timer (or distance_traveled)
		? charge and burst 
	- apply collision to body
	- apply gravity to body
	? follow a player
0.1) constraints
	- size and speed are inversly proportionate
	- each class has a limit of alive bodies per player
1) creation
	- body casting time is constant (but affected by casting speed)
	- during this phase the body cannot be grabbed
	x player can not cast a body if he is already holding one
2) lifetime
	- check for collision with players and ...
	- check for collision with map and ...
2.1) appending an effect
	- only to a curently held body
	- the appending takes no time
2.2) grabbing
	- only if grabbing is not locked
	- body cannot be grabbed when someone is casting an effect on it
	- release (in holders direction)
	- player can not grab a body if he is already holding one
2.3) merging (= appending body)
	- the parameters of the body that is being appended have no effect
	? increased body size with each appended body (multiply the base size)
	- increased effect power with each appended body
		(which will increase casting time - so variable casting time and effect power for effects is not needed)
	- simply cast an empty body - it will be merged to the first player (which is holding a body) it collides with
x 2.3.1) merging bodies with effects on them - probably wont be possible
	- effects are also appended
3) death

Magic effect
-----------------
? apply to: allies / enemies / both
0) parameters
	- type
	- base power
0.1) constraints
	- this class can cast the efect
	- limit the number of bodies with this effect per player
	- currently holding a body
1) creation
	- casting time varies by effect type
	- appended to curently held body
2) lifetime
	- effect is applied depending on the body	
4) death
	- with the body

Spell commands
-----------------
* spell_body_create(body params)
	* if holding a body, the new body will be appended
* spell_launch - launches the spell 
* spell_launch_now - resets casting and launches the spell
* spell_abort_now - aborts casting and empties the entire queue
* spell_cancel_now - cancels the currently held spell and resets casting (so that check for appending effect on no body can be done at dequeue) (or only when its an effect?)
- spell_effect_create(effect params)
- spell_grab
- spell_grab_lock
- spell_grab_unlock
- spell_grab_hand_lock
- spell_grab_hand_unlock
